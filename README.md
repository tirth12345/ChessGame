# Multiplayer Chess Game Project

Welcome to the Multiplayer Chess Game project! This repository contains the complete full-stack application for an engaging, real-time online chess platform with AI opponents, multiplayer features, tournaments, and more. The project focuses on scalable architecture, modern technologies, and production-grade deployment.

## Project Overview

This multiplayer chess game offers a rich set of features to create a modern, community-driven chess experience:

- Real-time multiplayer chess with low latency using WebSockets
- Play against AI powered by the Stockfish engine
- User accounts with secure authentication and personalized profiles
- Rating system to track player progress and matchmaking by skill level
- Tournament creation and management with bracket systems
- Chess puzzles and training modules for skill improvement
- Spectator mode to watch live games with chat functionality
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile devices
- Comprehensive analytics and game statistics

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js (UI)
- chess.js (Rules and move validation)
- react-chessboard (Chessboard UI component)
- Socket.IO client (Real-time communication)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js (API server)
- Socket.IO server (Real-time gameplay)
- Mongoose (MongoDB Object Data Modeling)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Redis (Caching, session management)

### Database
- MongoDB for persistent storage of users, games, moves, tournaments
- Redis for real-time cache, session storage, matchmaking queues, leaderboards

### AI Engine
- Integration with Stockfish chess engine for AI opponents of various difficulty levels

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling in production
- Nginx ingress controller for load balancing and SSL termination
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging setup

## Architecture Highlights

The system uses a modular design emphasizing scalability:

- **Frontend** handles UI, move input, game visualization, and communicates in real-time with backend via WebSocket.
- **Backend** manages game logic, matchmaking, user sessions, tournament logic, and AI integration.
- **Database schemas** optimized for efficient query performance and extensibility.
- **Redis caches** critical real-time data to ensure responsiveness.
- **AI Engine** is integrated as a separate microservice or process interacting asynchronously with the backend.

## Database Design

Key Collections:

- **Users:** credentials, profiles, ratings, preferences, session info
- **Games:** game state, players, move history, results, timestamps
- **Moves:** individual move records linked to games with validations and timing
- **Tournaments:** bracket setup, participants, match results, scheduling
- **Puzzles:** challenge problems with solutions and difficulty ratings

Redis caching supports:

- Active game states for low latency move validation
- Matchmaking queues categorized by skill rating
- User sessions and auth tokens
- Leaderboards with real-time updates

## Development Roadmap

The project development is planned over 24 weeks in 6 focused phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Environment setup and repo scaffolding
- Database schema design
- User authentication basic setup
- Backend and frontend baseline infrastructure

### Phase 2: Chess Engine (Weeks 5-8)
- Chessboard UI implementation
- Move validation and rules enforcement
- Single-player mode with basic AI

### Phase 3: Multiplayer (Weeks 9-12)
- Socket.IO real-time communication setup
- Matchmaking and game sessions
- Chat functionality and spectator mode

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-16)
- Stockfish AI integration for strong opponents
- Chess puzzles and training modules
- Tournament system implementation

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing (Weeks 17-20)
- UI/UX improvements and responsiveness
- Performance tuning, caching strategies
- Automated testing, security hardening

### Phase 6: Production Launch (Weeks 21-24)
- Deployment automation with CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring, logging, and analytics setup
- Production scaling and optimizations

## Security & Performance

- JWT-based authentication with token refresh
- Input sanitization and rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement and security headers
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing for performance
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Load balancing and automated failover in production

## Deployment Guide

- Build Docker images with multi-stage builds for optimized size
- Use Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes clusters manage deployment, autoscaling, and rolling updates
- Monitor with integrated tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows (linting, testing, building, deploying)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow environment setup for Node.js, Docker, MongoDB, Redis.
3. Configure environment variables (`.env` files) for frontend and backend.
4. Run backend and frontend servers locally or using Docker Compose.
5. Access the UI via `localhost` on the configured port.
6. Use API health checks to verify backend status.
